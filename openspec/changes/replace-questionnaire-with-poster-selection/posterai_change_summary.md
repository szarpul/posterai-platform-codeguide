# PosterAI Platform - Questionnaire Redesign

## Overview

Refocus PosterAI Platform from generic poster creation to a curated **art posters for home decor** experience with a visual-first, 3-step questionnaire that eliminates complex prompt writing.

## User Experience Changes

### New 3-Step Questionnaire

#### Step 1: Art Style Selection

User sees a visual grid displaying 7 art style categories. Each category shows high-quality example poster images. The user clicks on the image itself to select that style.

**Art Style Categories:**

1. Abstract Geometric
2. Minimalist
3. Botanical
4. Landscape
5. Surreal
6. Retro/Vintage
7. Cosmic/Space

**User sees:** Gallery-like grid with large example images, style names displayed subtly underneath or overlaid

#### Step 2: Color Palette Selection

User selects their preferred color palette from visual swatches showing actual color combinations (not just text labels).

**Color Palette Options:**

- Monochrome
- Earth Tones
- Ocean Blues
- Warm Sunset
- Forest Greens
- Vibrant/Bold
- Pastels

**User sees:** 5-8 visual color swatches to choose from

#### Step 3: Subject/Elements Selection

User selects specific subjects or elements. Options change dynamically based on the art style selected in Step 1.

**Subject Options by Style:**

- **Abstract Geometric:** Organic shapes, Geometric patterns, Fluid forms
- **Minimalist:** Lines, Shapes, Negative space, Simple forms
- **Botanical:** Flowers, Leaves, Trees, Abstract plants
- **Landscape:** Mountains, Ocean, Forest, Desert
- **Surreal:** Dreamscapes, Abstract forms, Unexpected combinations
- **Retro/Vintage:** Travel poster, Mid-century modern, Psychedelic
- **Cosmic/Space:** Planets, Nebulas, Stars, Galaxies

**User sees:** 3-5 options relevant to their chosen art style

### Post-Generation Experience

After completing the 3 questions, the system generates one poster image. User sees the generated poster with three action options:

**1. Regenerate**

- Creates a new poster using the same settings (same style, color palette, subject)
- No limit on how many times user can regenerate
- Shows a new result each time

**2. Save as Draft**

- Saves this poster to view and purchase later
- User can access saved drafts from their account/dashboard
- No limit on number of drafts saved
- Can return to any saved draft and proceed to checkout

**3. Proceed to Checkout**

- Takes user to poster customization (select size and finish)
- Then continues to payment and shipping

### What Stays the Same

- Checkout flow (size selection, finish selection, payment, shipping) remains unchanged
- Admin dashboard and order management remain unchanged
- This change affects only the questionnaire and post-generation experience
