# Tech Stack Document

This document explains, in simple terms, the main technologies we’re using to build our custom poster platform. It shows how each piece fits together to create a smooth experience—from choosing style options to receiving a printed poster at home.

## Frontend Technologies

On the user-facing side, we’ve chosen tools that make the website fast, responsive, and easy to update:

*   **React**

    *   A popular JavaScript framework that lets us build reusable pieces of the interface (components) such as buttons, forms, and preview panels.
    *   Helps keep the site snappy—only the parts of the page that need to change are updated when users make selections.

*   **React Router**

    *   Manages navigation on the site without full page reloads.
    *   Makes transitions between pages (Questionnaire, Preview, Checkout, etc.) feel smooth and instantaneous.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   A utility-first styling framework that lets us design layouts quickly and consistently.
    *   Ensures the platform looks good on desktop, tablet, or phone without writing lots of custom CSS.

How this enhances the user experience:

*   Instant feedback in the style questionnaire—users see choices reflected immediately in a preview.
*   Consistent look and feel across all pages, with clear buttons, forms, and readable fonts.
*   Responsive design ensures the site adapts to any screen size.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, these technologies power our data storage, business logic, and integrations:

*   **Supabase**

    *   A backend-as-a-service platform that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage.
    *   Handles user accounts, poster drafts, and order records efficiently.
    *   Offers real-time capabilities and easy integration with our frontend.

*   **Node.js & Express.js**

    *   The server runs on Node.js, a JavaScript environment that handles requests like “generate an image” or “place an order.”
    *   Express.js is a lightweight framework that organizes our API endpoints (for example: `/api/generate`, `/api/orders`).

*   **Authentication & Sessions**

    *   JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless user sessions.
    *   OAuth 2.0 integrations with Google and Facebook so users can log in without creating a new password.
    *   Passwords hashed using bcrypt to safeguard user credentials.

How these components work together:

1.  User submits a questionnaire → Frontend calls our Express API.
2.  Server takes the answers, calls the AI service, saves the returned image to Supabase storage, and records a draft in the Supabase database.
3.  When the user places an order, the server creates an order entry, charges the payment gateway, and sends printing instructions.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

We host and maintain the platform using services that ensure reliability and smooth updates:

*   **Version Control: Git with GitHub**

    *   All code changes are tracked in GitHub repositories.
    *   Pull requests and code reviews keep the code quality high.

*   **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

    *   GitHub Actions automatically builds and tests changes whenever code is pushed.
    *   Successful builds are deployed to our staging or production environment without manual steps.

*   **Hosting on Supabase**

    *   Application servers and databases are managed by Supabase, which provides automatic scaling and backups.

*   **Monitoring and Logging**

    *   Supabase provides built-in monitoring and logging tools to track performance and errors.

These choices make it easy to push updates, roll back if needed, and handle traffic spikes without downtime.

## Third-Party Integrations

Our platform leverages several external services to add functionality without rebuilding it all from scratch:

*   **OpenAI Image API (and future AI providers)**

    *   Generates the poster images based on questionnaire answers.
    *   Modular design means we can add Stability AI or other services later.

*   **Payment Gateways: Stripe & PayPal**

    *   Secure payment processing for credit cards and PayPal accounts.
    *   Automatic invoicing and receipts sent to customers.

*   **External Printing Service API**

    *   Sends finalized image files and print specifications directly to a print partner for fulfillment.
    *   Receives status updates (“In Production”, “Shipped”) that we relay back to users.

*   **OAuth with Google & Facebook**

    *   Simplifies sign-up and login by letting users authenticate with existing accounts.

Each integration handles a specialized task—AI generation, payments, or printing—so we can focus on delivering a great user experience.

## Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve built in safeguards and optimizations to keep data safe and the experience smooth:

Security Measures:

*   HTTPS everywhere ensures data in transit is encrypted.
*   Secure headers (HSTS, Content Security Policy) to protect against common web attacks.
*   Passwords hashed with bcrypt; JWT tokens signed securely.
*   Supabase roles restrict access to storage and database instances.
*   GDPR-compliant data handling with clear privacy policies.

Performance Optimizations:

*   Code splitting and lazy loading in React to reduce initial page load times.
*   Caching API responses where appropriate (e.g., questionnaire options).
*   Supabase's real-time capabilities for fast data updates.
*   Auto-scaling backend workers for AI requests to handle busy periods without slowdowns.
*   Monitoring thresholds and alerts so we can spot and fix performance issues quickly.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Our technology choices align perfectly with the project goals:

*   **Fast and Friendly Frontend:** React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS give users a modern, responsive interface.
*   **Powerful and Flexible Backend:** Supabase, Node.js, and Express handle data and business logic reliably.
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Supabase services and CI/CD pipelines ensure we can grow without outages.
*   **Specialized Integrations:** OpenAI for image generation, Stripe/PayPal for payments, and a printing partner’s API for fulfillment.
*   **Security & Performance Focus:** From encrypted connections to auto-scaling, the platform remains secure and responsive under all conditions.

Together, these technologies create a seamless journey: users pick from simple options, get AI-generated poster previews in seconds, save drafts, and place orders that are printed and shipped with minimal fuss. This setup keeps development efficient, operations smooth, and customers satisfied.
